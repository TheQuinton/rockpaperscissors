Rock Paper Scissors

This program was written as a class project to display an understanding of the basics of object-oriented design, through the use of a both a main class and player class. 

The game is played entirely in the console. Players start the game and are first asked to enter an odd number of rounds to per game followed by their names, as they will be used to create the save files, as well as to load pre-existing save files in order for player stats to carry over from previous play throughs of the game.
During each round of the game, player one has the choice of the letters: s,d,f; and player two has the choice of: j,k,l. At the beginning of each round, these letters are randomly assigned the values of rock, paper, or scissors. Both players make their inputs into the console at the same time and then press enter.
The game then informs the players of the outcome of the round, immediately after another round will start up following the same cycle of events. After the set number of rounds has been reached, the game ends and informs the players of the outcome, as well as their player stats.
